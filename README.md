# Darling Waifu

## Description
Darling Waifu is a Play-to-Business NFT game. It focuses on *waifus* (ワイフ, Japanese pronunciation for wife) as the primary workforce of the game.
This NFT game is located on the Binance Smart Chain and lets you play with a real-world and sustainable economy. This way, it let's you have fun at the same time you generate an income. The game token is called **$PEACH** and allows you to interact with different aspects of the game.

We have taken some protective measures with the smart contract to give the project, the users and their potential income a longer lifespan. You can see the details by reading the **smart contract** and the **litepaper**. There, you can review our tokenomics, objectives and our plan to make a big and sustainable community around the blockchain world.

## About the web
I know you are reading this file only if you are here for the source code. The Tech stack for the **landing page only** is just React. The page is hosted on the Netlify CDN to allow shockingly fast loading times for our users. This helps us distribute the load and get the page closer to our users.

### Technologies used:
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Particles.js](https://particles.js.org)

### TODO
- Change the elements of the landing page to allow you to play the game directly inside the browser (when the game gets to prod)

## About the project
We will soon publish our art, drawings and concepts to Open Sea. Be sure to get notifications on our social media in case you want to purchase them. They will most likely increase their price over time. In the mean time, we are searching for partners and investors interested in working together as a team. We really want to make this big and it will only happen if we walk this path together ❤️.
